            <p> JavaScript is a cross-platform, object- oriented scrpting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different
                directions. JavaScript lives inside a host enviroment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of theseenviroments to provide programmatic control over them. </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li> <u class="ucolor">Variable Declaration </u>JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScriptvariables must be identified
                    with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="spancolor">var x; </span> </li>
                <li> <u class="ucolor">Variable Assignment</u> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold.The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.
                    <span class="spancolor"> var x =10</span> ;
                </li>
                <li> <u class="ucolor">Data Types</u> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that area JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class="spancolor"> true</span>                    or <span class="spancolor"> false; </span> null- <span class="spancolor">null</span> aka nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159; String - "Coding Dojo Rocks!"; Array - <span class="spancolor">(1,'Coding', 2,'Dojo');</span> and Object -
                    <span class="spancolor"> {first_name:'Jane', last_name:'Doe'}
                        </span>
                </li>
                <li><u>Conditionals</u> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to
                    accomplish this. There are the following conditional statemets: <span class="spancolor">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="spancolor">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test,
                    if the first condition is false; else we execute this block of code;</li>
                <li> <u class="ucolor">Loops </u> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run
                    around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!;</li>
                <li> <u class="ucolor">Function </u>Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call out function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting togheter a desk from Ikea,
                    we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function
                    over and over and over again.</li>
